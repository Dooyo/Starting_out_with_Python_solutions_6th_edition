# 1 => Program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task.

# 2 => Hardware is physical component which a computer is made from.

# 3 => Input devices, Output devices, Secondary storage devices, Main Memory, CPU       

# 4 => The Central Processing Unit.

# 5 => The RAM(Random Access Memory.)

# 6 => Secondary storage devices are used to hold data for a long periods of time.

# 7 => Input devices collect data from people and from other devices.

# 8 => Output Devices.

# 9 => Operating Systems.

# 10 => Utility Programs

# 11 => Application Software.
 
# 12 => One Byte.

# 13 => bit(Binary Digit).

# 14 => Binary digits numbering system.

# 15 => It is used to represent english letters, various punctuations, numeric codes,
# marks, and other characters.

# 16 => Unicode is an extensive encoding scheme large enough to represent the 
# character of many languages.

# 17 => Digital data is data that is stored in binary form and digital device is any 
# device working with binary data.

# 18 => CPU only understands instructions that are written in machine language.

# 19 => Program has to be copied into RAM before it is executed by the CPU.

# 20 => Fetch --> Decode --> Execute cycle.

# 21 => Assembly languages use short words(mnemonics) for giving instructions
# that are changed to machine language by the assembler to execute a program.

# 22 => High Level Language.

# 23 => Syntax is a set of rules to be followed when writing a program.

# 24 => Compiler is a program that translates high level language into separate 
# machine language.

# 25 => Interpreter is a program that both translates and executes the instructions
#  in a high level language into machine langauge.

# 26 => Syntax 

#  TIP: Source code is statements programmer writes in a high level langauge.
